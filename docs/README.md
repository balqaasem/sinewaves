# SineWaves: Predictive Maintenance AI

## Overview

SineWaves is an advanced AI-powered predictive maintenance solution designed to anticipate equipment failures through sophisticated machine learning and signal processing techniques.

### The project is designed to:

- Process raw sensor data
- Extract meaningful features
- Detect anomalies
- Predict equipment failures
- Provide a flexible framework for different industrial applications

## Key Features

- Real-time Sensor Data Analysis
- Advanced Machine Learning Failure Prediction
- Anomaly Detection
- Predictive Maintenance Scheduling
- Comprehensive Fault Diagnosis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `sinewaves/`: Core application modules

## Quick Start

```python
from sinewaves.predictor import EquipmentPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = EquipmentPredictor()

# Load sensor data
predictor.load_sensor_data('path/to/sensor_data.csv')

# Predict potential failures
predictions = predictor.predict_failures()
```
